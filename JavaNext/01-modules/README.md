# The Java Module System

The biggest new feature in Java 9 is the Java module system.
These exercises explore the basics of the module system.
Doing these exercises outside of an IDE is recommended.
Use your favorite text editor (with Java syntax highlighting, for example Atom or VS Code) and use the `javac` and `java` commands from the command-line directly as described in the excercises.

## 01. two-modules

Goal of this exercise is to learn about module structure, module descriptor syntax and using the new command-line flags introduced on `java` and `javac`. Further instructions are in the `01-two-modules-begin` directory. This is also the starting point for the exercise.

## 02. services

Goal of this exercise is to learn how services can be used to decouple modules through a shared interface. Further instructions are in the `02-services-begin` directory.
