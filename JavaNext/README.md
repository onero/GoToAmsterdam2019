# Java.next labs

This repository contains exercises (and solutions) to get started with new features in Java 9 and later.

Make sure Java 11 is installed: https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot (a more recent version can be used for these labs as well).
You can find the JavaDoc for Java 11 at https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html

Using an IDE such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) is possible, but not required.
Each exercise (except the ones under `01-modules`) has a `pom.xml`, so you can easily import the exercise in for example IntelliJ.
An IDE, with all its configuration, sometimes obscures what's really happening.
Especially when learning about Java modules where new compilation and JVM flags are introduced.

Each individual directory contains further instructions for the exercises.
