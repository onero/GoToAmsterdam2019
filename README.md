Repository for findings, projects and knowledge from The GoTo Amsterdam 2019


## Recommendations
Make sure Java 11 is installed: [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) (a more recent version can be used for these labs as well).  
You can find the JavaDoc for Java 11 [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html).

Alternatively you can use [Brew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation.html) to install java.  
Just fire this command  
 ```brew cask install java ```  
 You can verify the version with  
 ```brew cask info java```
